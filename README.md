## Features

__Logo and Navigation bar__

In the header section I have created an Interactive logo which takes the user back to the Home page from any page within the website. I have also created Navigation links in the header which will take the user to the Reservation page, Menu page and back to the home page aswell. The design for the header section is consistent across all the pages.

__The Hero Image__

This is an eye-catching image of a Southernfried Chicken burger served along with a cocktail drink. This image is the landing image of the website which speaks for itself to convey to the user what to expect on this website.

__Footer__

The footer provides links to our social media handles like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram which opens in a new tab. The icons have been sourced from a website called fontawesome. The styling of the footer is consistent across all the pages within the website.

__The Reserve Page__

This page consists of a form which provides the user to fill in their details like Name, Email, Date and Time of visit, number of guests and also a comment box for any special requests. After filling all the required details, clicking on the Reserve button takes the user to a confirmation page letting the user know that their reservation is successful.

__The Menu Page__

The menu page is an interactive page wherein, whenever the user hovers the cursor over the sub-sections within the menu, it gives a zoom effect thereby engaging the user to focus on each section of the menu.

## Future Features

In the future I would like to add a Gallery page where we can share pictures of our food, team, guests and any special events for our users to view.
I would also like to make the menu section more interactive so the user can also select the food and drinks to order within the restaurant or take-away.

## Testing

I have tested the website on different platforms like Google Chrome and Firefox which works fine. 
I have manually tested all the navigation links within the website to be working as expected. 
I have tested all the social media links to make sure they work and open in a new tab. 
I have tested all  the hover stylings right from the navigation bar, Reserve button and the Menu and they work as expected.
The inframe google map works as expected.

### Validator Testing

I have run all my html pages in the official W3C Validator and no erros returned.
Ihave also run my CSS file in the official Jigsaw Validator and no errors returned.

### Lighthouse Testing

I have tested my website on the Lighthouse feature in the Google Chrome Dev tools and I am happy to say that my site has a sore of 94 in Performance, 100 in Accessibility, 92 in Best Practices and 100 in SEO.

### Bugs

The W3C Validator was showing an error in my index.html file as an unexpected ending </p> tag which i had used to enclose the address text. I tried to find any <p> tags which were not opned or closed properly but I couldnt find any. Then i decided to remove the <p> tag from the address text which resolved the error. However I am unsure if the address text can be enclosed in which tag.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
1) In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
2) From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
3) Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed   ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
